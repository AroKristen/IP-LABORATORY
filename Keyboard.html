            <p>A keyboard instrument is an instrument that is played by pressing the keys of a keyboard.<br>
                 In a keyboard, the notes are arranged with naturals (usually white notes)<br>
                 forming the main body of the keyboard,<br>
                 and sharps and flats (usually black notes) placed in cuttings into the upper half of the naturals.<br>

                <br>The ways in which the sound is made varies a lot:<br>
                
               <b> In the piano, hammers hit the strings.<br>
                In the organ, air is sent through pipes.<br>
                In the electronic organ or synthesizer, sound is made electronically.<br>
                In the harpsichord, the strings are plucked by quills or “jacks”.<br>
                In the clavichord, the strings are hit by a metal “tangent”. </b> <br>
               
                In the 17th and 18th centuries,<br>
                 the word Clavier was used in Germany to mean any kind of keyboard instrument.<br>
                Often, the naturals were black and the sharps and flats were white (see picture of harpsichord),<br>
                but the layout was exactly the same.<br>
                
                <b><u>Harpsichord 1980</u></b><br>
                A modern harpsichord with two manuals (keyboards). It is a copy of a Baroque instrument.<br>
                The development of electronic instruments in the 20th century has<br> 
                brought about many different types of electronic keyboard instruments. <br>
                These include the ondes Martenot and the synthesizer.<br>
                
                Nowadays, people often talk about a keyboard meaning an <br>
                electronic keyboard (e.g. “He plays the keyboard”).<br>
                
                Yamaha have now made the most successful keyboards, selling over 770,000 a year.</p>
