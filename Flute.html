            <p>flute, French flûte, German Flöte, wind instrument in which the sound is produced by a stream of air directed against a<br>
                sharp edge, upon which the air breaks up into eddies that alternate regularly above and below the edge, <br>
                setting into vibration the air enclosed in the flute. In vertical, end-vibrated flutes—such as the Balkan kaval,<br>
                 the Arabic nāy, and panpipes—the player holds the pipe end to his mouth, directing his breath against the opposite edge.<br>
                  In China, South America, Africa, and elsewhere, a notch may be cut in the edge to facilitate sound generation (notched flutes).<br>
                  Vertical nose flutes are also found, especially in Oceania. In transverse, or cross, flutes (i.e., horizontally held and side blown),<br>
                   the stream of breath strikes the opposite rim of a lateral mouth hole. Vertical flutes such as the recorder, 
                   in which an internal flue or duct directs the air against a hole cut in the side of the instrument, are known as fipple, or whistle, <br>
                   flutes. Flutes are typically tubular but may also be globular, as with the ocarina and primitive gourd flutes. <br>
                   If a tubular flute is stopped at the lower end, its pitch is an octave lower than that of a comparable open flute.<br>
                The earliest example of a Western end-blown flute . <br>
                The flute, made from the bone of a griffin vulture, has five finger holes and measures about 8.5 inches (22 cm) long. <br>
                It is thought to be at least 35,000 years old. Discoveries elsewhere in southwestern Germany yielded other flutes thought to be of similar age.<br><p></p>
