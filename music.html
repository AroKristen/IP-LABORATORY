            Music is an art that, in one guise or another, permeates every human society. Modern music is heard in a bewildering profusion of styles, many of them contemporary, 
            others engendered in past eras. Music is a protean art; it lends itself easily to alliances with words, 
            as in song, and with physical movement, as in dance. Throughout history, music has been an important adjunct to ritual 
            and drama and has been credited with the capacity to reflect and influence human emotion.<br>

           <b> “Music, once admitted to the soul, becomes a sort of spirit, and never dies.” <br>
            “Music touches us emotionally, where words alone can't.” “Where words fail, music speaks.” <br>
            “Music is the universal language of mankind.”</b> </p>
            
            <p> Music can be expressed in mainly two ways</p>

            <ul>
